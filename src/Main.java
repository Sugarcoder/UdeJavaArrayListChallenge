    Create a program that implements a simple phone with the following capabilities:
    - Able to store, modify, remove and query contact names.
    - Create a separate class for Contacts (name and phone Number).
    - Create a Master class (MobilePhone) that holds the ArrayList of Contacts.
    - The MobilePhone class has the functionality listed above.
    - Add a menu of options that are available.
    - Options: quit, print list of contacts, add new contact, update existing contact, remove contact, search/find contact
    - When adding or updating, be sure to check if the contact already exists (use name)
    - Be sure not to expose the inner workings of the ArrayList to MobilePhone (no ints, no .get(i)
    - MobilePhone should do everything with Contact objects only.
